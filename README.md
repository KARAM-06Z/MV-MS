# MVMS | Product managament system

<section>
  <div>
    <p>
      MVMS is a small project i made just in order to innovate myself and gain knowledge as i became an Angular front-end developer,<br>
      specifically made to have a great overview on how to use state management NgRX as well as rxJS in Angular2+.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is about a products managment in a watches store, it can view items in the store, add, edit and delete all in an easy to use one page web app.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is completely open to anyone to use on the github live page, this might be idiotic but it is fine for as long as the project 
      is really a test for my self as well as the code is safe on my account.

    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>
      By going to the live page on github at the following <a href="https://karam-06z.github.io/mvms/" target="_blank">link</a> you can run the app which will show you a Login page where you can enter only the admin account.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one account to mimic the idea that this is a site for authorized members who only have anything related to the store based on the store owner knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admin account is the only way to create other accounts but this idea can't be found in the site because this was not what I'm focusing on, of course it can be made at anytime.
    </p>

    <h4>To login please use the following fake account:</h4>
      <span>E-mail: karam@mail.com</span><br>
      <span>Password: 123456</span>
